📊 Retail Operations Performance Dashboard (Power BI)
🧠 Project Summary
This Power BI project was developed as part of a team assignment during my master's program at Emlyon Business School. The goal was to create a comprehensive dashboard for a retail company to track key performance metrics, identify inefficiencies, and support strategic decision-making. The analysis focuses on operations such as stock levels, sales performance, store efficiency, and customer behavior patterns across multiple business units.

Identify underperforming areas in store operations

Monitor key KPIs like stock turnover, sales per region, category breakdown

Assist business teams in scenario analysis and decision-making

📌 Key Features
